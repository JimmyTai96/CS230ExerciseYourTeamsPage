		<h1>About This Site</h1>
		<p>This website was created as part of the exercise where our team learned about web development. It was chellenging to creat, but nothing that we couldn't handle. Over, it was a fun experience.</p>
		<p>Jimmy Tai was the main author of this page. All the data are made up and most of me doing gibberish. HTML is a fun experience. Enjoy making this website.</p>
